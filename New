Ingredients
For my version, Iâ€™ve simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, cilantro, and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the exterior of the chicken caramelize into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to cook the onions separately, as it allows you to fully caramelize them into a sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy, savory chicken. For the rice, a quick par-boil with cardamom, bay leaves, and cumin infuses some flavor, while ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.
